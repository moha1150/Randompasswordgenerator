# Randompasswordgenerator
Generates eight random characters: two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters, two digits, and two symbols. It then adds these characters to the password string and shuffles them using the shuffle() function. The resulting password will be a 15-character string that contains a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols.

You can modify this code to generate a password of any length by generating more characters and adding them to the password string. Just be sure to include a mix of different character types to make the password more secure.
